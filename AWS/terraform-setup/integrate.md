Initialize Terraform in your project directory:
`terraform init`

This downloads the AWS provider plugin and sets up the working directory.
Review the plan to see what resources will be created:
`terraform plan`

Verify that the plan includes:

An IAM user
A policy attachment
An access key


Apply the configuration to create the resources:
`terraform apply`
When prompted, type yes to confirm.

Step 4: Retrieve and Use the Credentials

Get the Access Key ID:
terraform output access_key_id

Get the Secret Access Key (sensitive output):
terraform output -raw secret_access_key

Use these credentials in your CloudWatch integration platform.

Step 5: Cleanup (When No Longer Needed)
To remove all created resources:
`terraform destroy`
When prompted, type yes to confirm.

Common Issues and Troubleshooting

Authentication Errors

Verify your AWS credentials with: aws sts get-caller-identity
Ensure your credentials have permissions to create IAM users and policies


Region Issues

Make sure you're using a valid AWS region
Ensure CloudWatch is available in your selected region


Terraform State Management

The local terraform.tfstate file tracks your resources
For team environments, consider using remote state (S3, Terraform Cloud)
Never commit this file to version control as it may contain sensitive information


Permission Denied

Ensure your AWS credentials have IAM admin permissions
Sample policy needed:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}


Security Best Practices

Store Terraform state securely (not in code repositories)
Consider setting up key rotation
Use the principle of least privilege when configuring permissions
Use AWS IAM roles when possible instead of access keys
Monitor IAM users and access keys for unusual activity

This setup creates a dedicated user with the minimum required permissions for CloudWatch integration. Your users can now easily generate the necessary credentials without manually navigating the AWS console.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes.
